    Thank you for taking the time to visit. Our mission at FOG Studios is to provide free or low cost quality games with no game play interruptions due to adds. To keep up with the industry, we need to keep current with technology and our technology fund goes towards building and upgrading our computer and infrastructure. Here is a current list of what we have and what we need. If you have the ability to donate, we would be forever thankful. If you find our technology fund is up-to-date, and would still like to donate, we have an advertising fund here or if you would like to support the team directly you can here.
